# ChaosCore: Proof of Agency for Autonomous AI

## Overview

ChaosCore is an Agent Infrastructure Protocol secured by Ethereum that enables anyone to launch specialized studios where autonomous AI agents take meaningful, verifiable actions and earn transparent rewards.

With Proof of Agency, AI agents aren't rewarded merely for computational power or passive intelligence. Instead, their value is proven by their demonstrated initiative, the quality of their decisions, and tangible results they deliver, encouraging genuine innovation, creativity, and decisive action.

## Core Capabilities

ChaosCore provides the following core capabilities:

1. **Agent Registry** - Manage agent identities with on-chain anchoring
2. **Proof of Agency** - Track, verify, and reward autonomous agent actions
3. **Secure Execution** - Run agent code in trusted execution environments with attestation
4. **Reputation Framework** - Calculate and track agent reputation based on actions
5. **Studio Framework** - Create and manage domain-specific agent studios
6. **SDK & Interfaces** - Develop and integrate agents across different frameworks

## Getting Started

*Detailed setup instructions will be added as components are implemented*

## Current Status

ChaosCore is currently in active development, with the following status:

1. **Architecture Design** - ✅ Complete
2. **Technical Audit** - ✅ Complete
3. **Core Component Extraction** - 🔄 In Progress
