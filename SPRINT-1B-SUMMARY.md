# Sprint-1b Summary

## Overview

This sprint focused on extending the ChaosChain Governance OS with additional functionality for TEE attestation and blockchain simulation. These components are critical for ensuring secure, verifiable, and effective governance proposals.

## Key Deliverables

### 1. TEE Attestation System

- Implemented a Phala-style Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) attestation stub
- Created cryptographic verification for proposal integrity
- Developed an API interface for attestation operations
- Added comprehensive unit tests

### 2. Blockchain Simulation Harness

- Built a flexible transaction simulation engine
- Implemented parameterized adjustment for gas and fee factors
- Created tools for generating realistic blockchain transactions
- Added detailed reporting for simulation outcomes
- Included comprehensive unit tests

### 3. API Extensions

- Extended the API with new endpoints for attestation and simulation
- Updated data models and schemas
- Improved error handling and validation
- Connected simulation results to proposal verification flow

## Technical Implementation

### TEE Attestation

The TEE attestation system provides a mock implementation of Phala's TEE functionality, which will be replaced with actual TEE integration in production. The current implementation includes:

- Enclave ID generation
- Secure payload hashing
- Digital signatures for attestation
- Verification mechanisms

### Simulation Harness

The simulation harness provides tooling to generate realistic blockchain transactions and simulate the effects of governance proposals. Key features include:

- Random EVM transaction generation
- Support for common ERC20 and DeFi operations
- Gas and fee adjustment simulation
- Detailed cost analysis for proposal impacts

### API Design

The API has been extended with new endpoints for:

- Generating TEE attestations
- Retrieving attestation data
- Running simulations
- Accessing simulation results

## Next Steps

For the next sprint, we plan to:

1. Integrate with a testnet for live transaction data
2. Expand the simulation capabilities with more DeFi scenarios
3. Implement AI-driven proposal generation
4. Add integration tests for the full governance flow

## Testing

All new components have comprehensive unit tests with good coverage. Both the TEE attestation system and the simulation harness have been validated with detailed test cases.
