# ChaosCore Technical Sprint Planning

## Overview

This document provides detailed sprint planning for the ChaosCore implementation, building upon the existing architecture and implementation plans. It translates high-level goals into specific engineering tasks with clear deliverables and acceptance criteria.

## Immediate Focus: Core Extraction & Governance Studio Refinement

Our strategy is to extract core components while simultaneously refining the governance studio as our reference implementation. We prioritize a demo-able MVP early in the process to validate our approach with real-world usage.
