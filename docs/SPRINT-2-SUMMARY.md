# ChaosCore Sprint 2 Summary: Proof of Agency & Secure Execution

This document summarizes the work completed during Sprint 2, which focused on implementing the Proof of Agency framework and Secure Execution Environment.

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Proof of Agency Core

- ✅ Implemented `Action` interface and `ActionRecord` implementation
- ✅ Implemented `Outcome` interface and `OutcomeRecord` implementation
- ✅ Implemented `ProofOfAgencyInterface` and `InMemoryProofOfAgency` implementation
- ✅ Created basic storage implementation
- ✅ Added adapter methods for backward compatibility with existing code
- ✅ Created comprehensive unit tests for all components
- ✅ Added integration tests with Agent Registry

### 2. Secure Execution Environment

- ✅ Designed and implemented `SecureExecutionEnvironment` interface
- ✅ Implemented mock TEE integration (`MockSecureExecutionEnvironment`)
- ✅ Created `AttestationProvider` interface and mock implementation
- ✅ Implemented `Attestation` interface and `MockAttestation` implementation
- ✅ Created comprehensive unit tests for all components
- ✅ Added integration tests with Proof of Agency

### 3. Integration Between Components

- ✅ Connected Agent Registry with Proof of Agency
- ✅ Linked attestations to actions
- ✅ Demonstrated end-to-end flow from agent registration to verified action with attestation
- ✅ Created comprehensive integration tests for cross-component workflows

### 4. Demo

- ✅ Created demo script that demonstrates the Proof of Agency and Secure Execution working together
- ✅ Implemented a sample market analysis task executed in the secure environment
- ✅ Demonstrated the full flow from execution to reward distribution

## Architecture Overview

### Proof of Agency Framework

The Proof of Agency framework provides:

1. **Action Recording**: Agents can record actions they perform with detailed metadata
2. **Verification**: Actions can be verified by other agents
3. **On-Chain Anchoring**: Verified actions can be anchored on-chain for permanent record
4. **Outcome Recording**: Results of actions can be recorded and associated with the actions
5. **Reward Distribution**: Rewards can be computed and distributed based on agent contributions

### Secure Execution Environment

The Secure Execution Environment provides:

1. **Isolated Execution**: Code can be executed in an isolated environment
2. **Attestation**: Executions are attested with cryptographic proofs
3. **Verification**: Attestations can be verified by third parties
4. **Result Recording**: Execution results are captured and can be integrated with Proof of Agency

## Implementation Details

### Key Interfaces

- `Action`: Represents an action performed by an agent
- `Outcome`: Represents the outcome of an action
- `ProofOfAgencyInterface`: Core interface for the Proof of Agency framework
- `SecureExecutionEnvironment`: Core interface for secure execution
- `AttestationProvider`: Interface for generating and verifying attestations

### Key Classes

- `ActionRecord`: Implementation of the `Action` interface
- `OutcomeRecord`: Implementation of the `Outcome` interface
- `InMemoryProofOfAgency`: In-memory implementation of the Proof of Agency framework
- `MockSecureExecutionEnvironment`: Implementation of the Secure Execution Environment
- `MockAttestation`: Implementation of the `Attestation` interface
- `MockAttestationProvider`: Implementation of the `AttestationProvider` interface

## Testing

We created comprehensive test suites for all components:

- Unit tests for Proof of Agency
- Unit tests for Secure Execution Environment
- Integration tests for Proof of Agency with Agent Registry
- Integration tests for Proof of Agency with Secure Execution

## Next Steps

For Sprint 3, we should focus on:

1. **Reputation System**: Implement the reputation system based on agent actions
2. **Studio Framework**: Create the studio framework for hosting agent workspaces
3. **Blockchain Anchoring**: Enhance on-chain anchoring for Agent Registry and Proof of Agency
4. **SDK Foundation**: Implement core SDK functionality for agent developers

## Conclusion

Sprint 2 successfully delivered all planned components with high test coverage. The core functionality of the Proof of Agency framework and Secure Execution Environment is now in place, providing a solid foundation for the rest of the ChaosCore platform.
