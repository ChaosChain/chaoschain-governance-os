# ChaosChain Governance OS Demo

This document describes how to run and use the ChaosChain Governance OS demo, which showcases the AI-powered blockchain governance capabilities.

## Overview

The demo consists of:

1. **Real-time Agent Feed** - Live view of the AI agents interacting, showing their thought processes, tool usage, and decision-making in real-time.
2. **Proposal View** - The final governance proposal generated by the AI agents, including parameter optimizations.
3. **Metrics Dashboard** - Performance metrics showing the impact of the proposed changes.

## Running the Demo

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- Node.js 18+
- Docker and Docker Compose (optional, for full containerized demo)

### Option 1: Using Docker (recommended for full experience)

The most straightforward way to run the full demo:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/ChaosChain/chaoschain-governance-os.git
cd chaoschain-governance-os

# Set up API key (required)
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env to add your OpenAI API key

# Run the end-to-end demo
./scripts/demo_e2e.sh
```

Then open your browser to http://localhost:8080/ui to see the dashboard.

### Option 2: Frontend-only Mode (for UI development)

To run just the frontend with mock data (no real agent computation):

```bash
# Setup frontend
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then open your browser to http://localhost:5173 to see the dashboard.

## Using the Demo

The demo shows how AI governance agents collaborate to:

1. **Analyze blockchain data** - The Gas Metrics Researcher examines on-chain gas metrics from the Ethereum blockchain.
2. **Generate optimizations** - Based on the analysis, the Parameter Optimizer creates parameter adjustments to improve chain performance.
3. **Simulate changes** - The proposed changes are simulated and evaluated for their impact.

### Live Agent Feed

The left panel shows the real-time agent activity:

- **Color-coded agent badges** identify which agent is performing each action
- **Thought processes** show the reasoning behind agent decisions
- **Tool usage** demonstrates how agents interact with blockchain data
- **Auto-scroll** follows the latest activity (can be toggled)

### Proposal & Metrics

The right panel shows the final outputs:

- **Governance proposal** with parameter adjustments and rationale
- **Performance metrics** showing the impact on gas price, throughput, etc.
- **Attestation badge** indicating if the proposal has been verified

## Extending the Demo

To add your own agents or functionality to the demo:

1. Create new agent classes in `agent/agents/`
2. Add new tools in `agent/tools/`
3. Modify the agent workflow in `agent/runtime/demo.py`

See the [Development Guide](development.md) for more details.
