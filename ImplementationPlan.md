# ChaosCore Implementation Plan

## Objectives

1. Extract core platform capabilities from the governance implementation to create a reusable, domain-agnostic agent infrastructure protocol.

2. Establish clear boundaries between platform-level components and domain-specific implementations through well-defined interfaces and abstractions.

3. Implement the Proof of Agency framework to enable transparent tracking, verification, and rewarding of autonomous agent actions.

4. Create a robust SDK and developer tools that enable seamless integration with existing agent frameworks and rapid development of new agent studios.

5. Maintain backward compatibility with the existing governance implementation while enabling a path for its gradual migration to the new architecture.

## Glossary

- **Agent**: An autonomous AI entity with a defined role, capabilities, and identity that can perform actions and participate in studios.
- **Studio**: A domain-specific collective of agents organized to achieve particular objectives (e.g., governance, science, content moderation).
- **Action**: A discrete, verifiable step taken by an agent that produces measurable outcomes (e.g., analysis, proposal, decision).
- **Receipt**: A cryptographically verifiable record of an agent's action, including inputs, outputs, and execution context.
- **Proof-of-Agency**: A mechanism for transparently tracking, validating, and rewarding autonomous AI agent actions based on demonstrated effectiveness and measurable impact.
- **Verification Mesh**: A distributed network of verifiers that validate agent actions according to domain-specific criteria.
- **Reputation Framework**: A system for calculating, tracking, and representing agent reputation based on verified actions and outcomes.
- **Secure Execution**: Isolated, attestable execution environments for agent code with verifiable integrity guarantees.

## Extraction Work Plan

1. **Outcome: Agent Registry Core Implementation** - ✓ IMPLEMENTED - Core identity management has been extracted into `chaoscore/core/agent_registry/` with interfaces, implementation, and demonstration code. Next steps include expanding test coverage and documentation.

2. **Outcome: Proof of Agency Framework** - ✓ IMPLEMENTED - Action logging, verification, and attestation have been extracted into `chaoscore/core/proof_of_agency/` with interfaces and implementation. Next steps include integration with governance components and expanded verification mechanisms.

3. **Outcome: Ethereum Integration Layer** - Refactor blockchain monitoring, contract interaction, and anchoring into `chaoscore/core/ethereum/` with abstract interfaces and concrete implementations; includes documentation on integration patterns and sample contract implementations.

4. **Outcome: Secure Execution Environment** - Extract execution isolation and security boundaries into `chaoscore/core/secure_execution/` with interface definitions, reference implementations, and security validation tests.

5. **Outcome: Reputation Framework** - Move reputation calculation and tracking into `chaoscore/core/reputation/` with pluggable scoring models, persistence, and graph-based representation; includes visualization tools and example analysis notebooks.

6. **Outcome: Studio Framework Primitives** - Extract agent coordination patterns into platform-level abstractions in `chaoscore/core/studio/` with configuration-based studio definition, agent lifecycle management, and cross-agent communication; includes example studio implementations.

7. **Outcome: Comprehensive SDK & Documentation** - Build unified SDK interfaces in Python and TypeScript with auto-generated documentation, interactive examples, and integration guides; includes migration guides for existing governance implementations.

8. **Outcome: Governance Studio Adaptation** - Update existing governance implementation to use the ChaosCore platform components, demonstrating the benefits of the extracted architecture and providing a reference implementation of a complete studio.

## Current Progress

Two core components have already been successfully extracted:

1. **Agent Registry** - Provides identity management for agents with interfaces, implementation, and example usage
2. **Proof of Agency Framework** - Implements action logging, verification, and attestation with clear interfaces

The next priority is to implement the Ethereum Integration Layer which will provide blockchain connectivity for the existing components, followed by the Secure Execution Environment.
